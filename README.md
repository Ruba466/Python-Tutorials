This repository contains some of my basic Python programs created for practice and learning. These scripts cover fundamental concepts like input/output, loops, functions, file handling, and more.

## Program List

### `SumofNumbers.py`
A simple Python script that takes input from the user and calculates the sum of all numbers up to that number.

### `ReverseNumber.py`
Takes an integer input and prints its reverse. Demonstrates use of loops, string slicing, or arithmetic logic.



## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed. Run any script using:

```bash
python filename.py
