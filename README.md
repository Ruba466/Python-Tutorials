This repository contains some of my basic Python programs created for practice and learning. These scripts cover fundamental concepts like input/output, loops, functions, file handling, and more.

## Program List

### `SumofNumbers.py`
A simple Python script that takes input from the user and calculates the sum of all numbers up to that number.

### `ReverseNumber.py`
Takes an integer input and prints its reverse. Demonstrates use of loops, string slicing, or arithmetic logic.

### `flush.py`
Demonstrates the difference between printing characters with and without using flush in Python.

### `output_to_file.py`
Prints a string to a file using the file= parameter in the print() function. Output saved to Output.txt.

### `python_operators.py`
This Python program demonstrates the use of all basic types of **operators** in Python, using user input.

### `calendar1.py`
This Python program to display the calendar of a given month and year

### `calendar2.py`
This Python program demonstrates the use of all basic types of **operators** in Python, using user input.

### `python_loops.py`
This Python program demonstrates basic loops and if-else, elif ladder statements.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed. Run any script using:

```bash
python filename.py
